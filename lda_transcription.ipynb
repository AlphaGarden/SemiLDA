      "Hello and welcome to the next slumbering Oblivion Kickstarter. My name is James AKA reclusive Phoenix and I'm the owner of reclusive Phoenix entertainment. This is the third Kickstarter in this time. We are funding the human forces that inhabit the world of some bring Oblivion in our first Kickstarter. We funded many models for the Cthulhu lien host. And now we're going to fund their counterparts the year in the game is 2175. And the war with the cooling armies has been waging for almost a century Humanities being pushed towards Extinction in the only thing preventing utter defeat or the soldiers of Earth's the elite fighting force has the planet is Unified under the auspices of the Human Alliance and defensive Earth and sea or as is more commonly known Hades.The most advanced Warriors in the eighties arson or of the genetically engineered cybernetic soldiers also known as gex these are Vat grown genetically engineered humans that are designed to be the peak of human evolution combined with cutting-edge cybernetics to interface with our battle suits and weapons. The gex forces are divided into three distinct groups first or the interdiction and Rapid engagement forces or ire these RDX with light armor battle suits and the excel at quick hit and run engagements or missions that require stealth. The next or the heavily armored tactically tour hate troops. These are more heavily armed gaxx that excel at Close Quarters and ranged fighting in a final group are called scorned. These are super heavy battle suits that are essentially walking tanks manned by a guest Trooper. Now the plan for this Kickstarter to fund the first Squad of guess troops and that Squad will be comprised of three Ira Troopers and to hey Troopers ideally will reach the initial funding go pretty quick so we can move into some of the other human fighting forces like the human infantry to robotic troops psychics drones and many others now everything funded in this Kickstarter will join the line of Miniatures that are already produced in our previous kickstarter's and while the previous Miniatures were based on physical sculpts the Miniatures in this Kickstarter based off of 3D models. However, they will have the same level of quality and detail that are Miniatures are known for as we have some very detailed and talent. 3D artist working on them This Kickstarter is just the next stage in making the slumbering Oblivion tabletop wargame and a larger World inhabits a reality. Now. I decided to approach this by going in manageable calculated stages to give the best chance of success for the overall game and by funding items with a longer timeframe first such as the Miniatures it will help speed up the process of getting the full game into backers hands quicker once we get to that point. Now for those of you that have backed either verb, either of our previous kickstarter's or this one will have picked up the Miniatures at the best prices. They will likely ever be offered and you'll be the first people able to play as you'll already have the Miniatures and just be in need of the rules now as far as the rules go there in process. They're being developed by some pretty well-known people in the war gaming industry. I'd started off initially trying to do my own rule set, but realized fairly quick that, you know, it's best left to Professionals in the people. I've found and are working on it have many years of experience and are pretty well-known in the war gaming world as having worked on some of the most popular war games out right now, so please back the project helped us. Bring this game to fruition in the more items. We can unlock in this Kickstarter the better the end result will be in a more options again will contain. So thanks so much for your time. Appreciate you watching this video and I hope to see you as a backer. Take care.\n",

      "There's a ninja in the room with you right now. You can tell because you can't see them. You just have to hope they're not here to kill you. Hey there, I'm Mike Jackson was with double exclamation games and I'm here to invite you to the ultimate stealth assassin Showdown ninjas. Ninjas is a game of secrecy and simultaneity in which two to four of the deadliest martial arts experts have gathered in one place with one purpose to be the last one standing in this game all players share the same grid but all ninjas are hidden from view on each turn players must use previous moves to try to deduce where their opponents are while trying to evade attacks themselves. In order to be victorious players must learn and use the 12 styles of ninja and every ounce of their cunning and courage to strike when the time is right. Now with so many Battle Royale and Search and Destroy games out there. You might be wondering why should you try ninjas? What makes you unique and better yet? What does it add to your board game collection? Number one ninjas features a brand new deduction mechanic. If you're like me, you're always looking for a game that will challenge you to think and plan a different way and it achieves this through secret and simultaneous Gameplay at the beginning of the game all names are hidden from view, but based on your enemy patterns of attacks. You can try to narrow down where they're moving. You also have to be careful in order to get to a place where you can hit them. You have to enter their attack range as well. This process is Search and Destroy while trying to stay hidden yourself keeps you thinking reacting the whole game number two replayability. Now, I don't know if replayability is a real word, but it's a real experience in ninjas. I play this game so many times since I first jotted down a pen and paper version of it years ago and I'm still finding new strategies and new surprises. Even when I'm playing with the same people unlike a lot of classic strategy games every game of ninjas can be played on a differently laid out map and with different starting positions. The cards are the twelve Styles ninja give you even more variations that every player can use differently every game number three low time commitment. This feature was really important in the creation of ninjas. Sometimes it's great to set aside a whole evening for a board game. But sometimes you need a game that you can set up play through and put away in half an hour. Even though there are many different strategies to learn a ninja's. The mechanics are simple enough that a new group of players could sit down and jump into a game in minutes now couple that with the deduction elements and the replayability. You've got a game that you could bust out on any occasion and we're practically any group of players number for everybody wants to be a ninja Let's be honest ninjas are cool and it is fun to play one. Even for just a game when I was a kid. I wanted to grow up to be a ninja and I know I'm not the only one now, if you want to be the one of the first people to own your own copy of ninjas the stealth assassin Showdown, then you can do that for our Kickstarter fund raiser take a look at our backing tears and find the level of ninja that is right for you.

      "Hi, I'm Emily. And I've created a simple wooden toy that can teach computer science to young children and many different ways. I'm a former scientist turned stay-at-home mom. My husband Grant is an award-winning expert in elementary Computer Science Education. We are all about preparing our kids for the future through activities that build problem solving skills.We've created hundreds of computer science learning activities and I have tried them out with our own kids on a daily basis. We've been documenting the process and sharing the results on social media. We love using household materials to quickly set up learning experiences that engage our toddlers. However, there were times when we wanted to teach certain Concepts and didn't have the right materials laying around the house. We wanted a toy that could be used to learn computer science Concepts that doesn't take up a lot of space and also encourages creativity in our kids. We found Montessori type blocks that at first seemed to fit but we're upwards of $300 for a set and we're not versatile enough. This is when the idea of pixel blocks was created Pixel blocks are small wooden cubes. Each side is painted one color. So one Cube can be used six different ways. We've developed activities that teach different concepts including binary debugging pattern matching algorithms, even internet protocols and more. We've included an activity guide to give you ideas on how to use these blocks with your kids or in the classroom. We would love to have pixel blocks in as many kids hands as possible. But the process to make a set is very time consuming it took us over four hours to make one set. But with the proper tools we could streamline the process. And if we got a very high demand we would reach out to a manufacturer to make the blocks for us. We'd love for you to pledge and get your own set of pixel blocks with included activity guides where you'll see how you can use the blocks in a ton of different ways. This isn't just the launch of pixel blocks when you pledged your helping launch a series of activities and toys that your kids and students can learn from and create with as you prepare them for the future. Thank you so much for making these blocks possible and helping us get pixel blocks and to as many children's hands as possible.\n",

      "two green tied it approaches The green tide is a set of obj and STL files for 3D printing whose purpose is to allow you to make almost any orc you can imagine. It contains multiple heads torsos arms and legs and a few extra pieces to combine to make an entire Legion. These files are designed with a Peg and whole system so that for example, you can print out and assemble the individual pieces. You want to make your own custom orc, although to be fair. I would suggest instead that you load them into your modeling application of choice. Whether mesh mixer blender even 3D Studio Max, I don't care it's whatever you're comfortable with. That way. You'll have a much more cohesive figure because when you assemble with Megan hold it will always be a bit of a gap. But among other things. I'm just bases both flat and round both textured like these guys and with a flat surface so you can add whatever texture you want. And just to give you an idea on just how versatile this whole thing. Is this this is just the heads. That many heads and all of the parts are interchangeable. Although I would suggest not putting a shield on a weapon armed that cannot be a little awkward. It also includes five boars. And three writing legs so that you can mount your Orcs on wild little piggies. Little being subjective, of course. So yes, I've even printed out these myself just to get a feel for them and they print and paint beautifully. so prepare yourself and your group. for the green tide\n",

      "Hey everyone. Thanks for checking out gaming honors. Second Kickstarter The Exodus of wolfbane. This module is going to let your players take their characters from zero level peasants to second level heroes over the course of multiple sessions so that you want to tell us a little bit about the accessible thing. It's epic in many ways. We've got length of Storytelling. This is at least four deep sessions. It's epic in the journey you start in one place and it takes weeks and weeks of travel to get to the end epic in the responsibility. You're worried about your team your fellow villagers 50 or so, you might have to protect as you make this great journey. So you start with peasants. They're just sort of normal people 0 level and then this cataclysm comes there's a strange Elder that's in their Town that's mute. And sometimes it doesn't even seem to recognize people around him name shed aford he's been around longer than even the oldest people in the village can remember the king knows that Xiao deferred as some kind of amazing ability.Wants to see it for himself and in a panic mayor sassafras sends an imposter to try and fool the king and the King makes the town of wolfbane pay the king doesn't suffer fools. It opens with this big horrific battle the villagers getting punished for this mistake. They've made the characters you play are drawn from the survivors your job is to try and help the remaining citizens of wolfbane Escape The King and his men and reach this kind of mythical place called stonewater the story revolves around this shatter for character on some level. It's a mystery. He's got a lot of Secrets. He's hard to understand. He doesn't communicate well, and these layers get peeled back each week when Shadow furred was left in the village as a baby. He had this map with him that map is what gives you the idea to go to Stone water in the first place. And as you retrace his steps you do have the possibility.To figure out what happened to him. He has with them this box. This box is as mysterious as he is. There are Clues both in the adventure itself. And on the map and on the box that might give players an insight into how to use the items of the box to to sort of solve the mystery or to right a wrong. It's fun for the players to explore this box. What does it do? When should it be used? How should it be used? What are the consequences the box is very open-ended and how you use it players love this because all kinds of crazy wonderful exciting dramatic things can happen with it when that brought this to our table. I remember Lance he said like you would never done something like this before this kind of extended Trek a true Exodus where you're trying to save people's lives. It's got elements of a survival campaign. It's got elements of a chase the Quarry and encounter cards to help you keep track when you're doing initiatives if you want to know sort of the stats of the NPC'sThe antagonist you're fighting we have these cards for you. You can just cut them out Mark the initiative order and then you've got everything you need for those encounters the character and the creation of the village that that was able to pull off with just very small Nuance tidbits about all of the 300 characters Sasha rousse key. She's one of the creepy triplets Kristen pickle can play the fiddle, but Dilbert pickle can perform songs with his nose. So some of these are really silly but some of these are very useful and that's important because of the structure that we've built this game turgon knows how to set traps that might be useful to help get food. Of course, you're going to fight monsters and you're going to fight the evil soldiers, but you're also fighting the environment and you are trying to keep up the morale. How are you going to keep people's spirits up because if their Spirits drop you've worked in a mechanic where the party will pay for that every decision you make matters Shadow Ford was nearly killed in that first battle at the Village. You've got to keep him alive.That we have to bring up the Nemesis. Mr. Standish. He is a really nasty nasty cruel Sheriff of Nottingham on a really bad day type of guy and we're counting on the judges to make him as bad as he possibly can be included in all of that are a number of really fun handouts. This is a letter that also is included with the box. And of course, it gives you some Clues and a little bit of the history you get a look what I found card. You get one card use it one time and what does it get you? Hey, look what I found in the back of the wagon here Zack. Maybe it was a bowl that you desperately need maybe was a piece of armor, whatever the judge seems is reasonable with the collaborative storytelling element the more that you can incorporate as a player why that would make any sense the more the judge would say, yeah. You know what? That's probably Fair. Here's one you get one of these shadow Ford sees the future. You're in a real pickle. Should we go this way? Should we go that way? Maybe this gives you a little hint Shadow forward is anAnd sleep powerful figure if you have the card and times are desperate the players have that one chance to pull out Shadow fur does something amazing and he will it's whatever the players make up. Yeah, there is no way to predict none of these locations on this map have any meaning to you whatsoever. You've never heard of any of these places. You've never been to any of these places everything that you come upon is new exciting an eye-opening and exotic. It's a very interesting world. You're going to go through impassable mountains choking fog destroyed cursed cities. These are unique settings. You're not in one setting you're traveling for weeks and each one is different. This adventure is primarily designed as a theater of the Mind experience except for the big finale battle when you really need to know exactly where everyone is position matters as wave after wave of bad guys come in. It's reallyDriven for the majority. I've done a some of the drawings the basic pen and ink stuff that I did before and Thad found another local artists that we're really excited about that has a little bit of a different style and fad himself took on some more of it again. And so pretty proud of it. There are Mysteries to solve there are villains to conquer but how that happens. It's going to be different every time. Yeah, and one of the things that we've done is we've got a great Indiana Jones style chase scene that we've been wanting to do for a long time. And and of course it wouldn't be a great Chase sequence. If you weren't just happened to be really close to a cliff. You know, of course the Great Adventure has a have a great epic finale custom map that's filled with all kinds of wonderful details and interesting things for you to interact with and develop strategies with you. Got to think about. Okay, they're coming. How can we use our surroundings for defense for offense? How can we slow them down? How long are you going to study that map and figure out?To do to protect yourself. Right? Right. There's a Siege mechanic you can get very creative with the siege weapons fad did some horrific things to us those villagers that died that Parish at the raising of wolfbane. They may become ammunition. The plant life there is actually critical to if you're desperate and you really need something to bring back those hit points. You might want to grab a bite of that weird looking plant and hope for the best. We don't want players to just know what's going to happen next and so Stone water itself is a surprise. So I hope you can see we are really excited to bring the excess of wolfbane to you. We've been working really hard on it. We've been having a ball play testing it and now it's your turn. So please back our Kickstarter take this game to your table and have fun with it because I can tell you something it's going to be epic.\n",

      "Hey you. Yes, you don't you wish there was a way to instantly have friends to have sitting alone at lunch and constantly questioning your self-worth. Well, unfortunately, we don't have that but we do have is a cool card game. Ladies and gentlemen, this is me and break me break is the perfect combination of past and present means Each meme whether good or bad has contributed to the way memes are made today. And while it's tempting to want to burn some of these in a dumpster fire. We here at Iris games encourage you to look back on these dead means in a nostalgic light rather than in a spiteful one, but what exactly is mean break the rules of the game are quite simple. There are three types of cards memes breaks and discard power memes are well memes cards that have in some point since the internet's creation been a meme for one reason or another next. There are break cards brakes are sentences that have breaks in them that will later be filled in with the means each round of meme break a players picked us the card connoisseur. He picks a break card from the deck and reads it off each player. Then puts a meme card face down in front of the judge that best fits the brake and whichever card the judge things is the funniest wins the round we've all In there stuck in a hopeless game with no. Hope of winning as it just keeps dragging on. That's why I mean break has a third type of card discard power you get unlucky with your cards and your far behind you don't need to soak as your friends. Kick, you more and more into the dirt the most threatening player can be the one who has nothing to lose by discarding one of their break cards a player can pick a discard power card from the deck and use its effects from reversing the judging order to setting other players back people will make sure to be extra friendly to you to make sure you don't ruin their Victory with these cards. Each me made me break has been manually approved and quality tested to ensure that memes are recognizable relevant and entertaining. I also believe that sometimes impromptu moments are the most memorable. So each set will come with a hearty amount of wild cards allowing the experience to always be fresh and customizable. Well, there's already a cardless created. We will also take suggestions from the community for memes and breaks communication with the community is the most important thing for us will consider suggestions. Whether it's for the base set or one of the inevitable expansions down the road right now. There's a Kickstarter up why have a prototype the money from the kickstarter would allow me to mass order the card game as a high school student. I really don't have enough money to invest in my idea all on my own if you're interested in supporting the game or even buying it for yourself, please check out the kickstarter. The kickstarter is All or Nothing. So even if we don't reach our goal, you still get your money back free of charge if you still want to support, but you aren't willing to pay I would still appreciate it. If you liked and shared the video if you're interested in future mean break updates subscribe to the channel, or if you're a YouTuber and you'd like review copy to make a video on the card game. I can do my best to get you one. If there's enough interest. I'll have more videos coming out in the future to explain more about the card game. Take care. Good. Bye and enjoy the rest of your day.\n"
