      "                 Ocean Crisis is a cooperative worker placement game which depicts this real life marine ecosystem disaster caused by pollution. The game also simulates some of the crucial approaches and policies that we can adopt in reality to cope with such disaster.   Players take on the roles of the Ocean Defense Team. By cleaning up the massive amount of garbage, conducting researches and developing eco-skills, team members will strive to stop the formation of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, a.k.a., the Garbage Island.             Within a game, players will also go through a number of environmental rescue missions and scenarios regarding marine life and the ecosystem, each providing unique mechanisms and storylines for players to challenge.       GAMEPLAY OVERVIEW                            Each Ocean Crisis game starts with 10 meeples, regardless of the numbers of players. The goal is to survive through 6 rounds by preventing garbage tiles from filling all spaces of the Garbage Island. Each game-round can be divided into  3 main steps :  Step I. Planning  Before taking actions, all players first place their meeples at different locations on the map simultaneously. Players can choose between cleaning up garbage directly, or investing in green technology and eco-skills that will take effect in the future.       Step II. Action  The core actions in the game are  Garbage Cleanup  and  Eco Movement . Roll a die to determine whether a piece of garbage is cleaned up, reduced or put into research. different team members can work together on a single tile of garbage.  The Eco-Movement, on the other hand, represents a more preventive measure. Players take turns to pave road to upgrade personal skills, such as recycling and reduction; green technologies and reinforcements can also be activated within this action.            Step III. River Flow & Ocean Current  At the end of each round, all garbage tiles flow downstream along the river, and eventually end up in the ocean. As marine debris, the garbage will then drift along in the ocean current, from seashore to offshore, and from the ocean to the Garbage Island!     The Ocean Current Disk from the game simulates the dynamic nature of marine debris, which circulates within the ocean current.

BACKGROUND STORY  According to the  official report  released by United Nations Environmental Protection (UNEP), each year there are more than  8 million tonnes  of plastic waste leaking into the ocean, equivalent to dumping a garbage truck full of plastic every minute.   Since the 21st century, marine pollution has been one of the most devastating human-made environmental disasters on earth, causing ocean life to cease faster than ever before.

Wu)    When designing Ocean Crisis, we try to simulate the reality of our environment: the never-ending amount of garbage production, the insufficient resources (in our case, meeples) that we have to cope with this situation, and limited technology existed to fix the disaster.  In the end, it is not about winning the game or conquering any evil entity. It is about the decisions we make throughout our journey after learning about our ocean.     The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is massive! (photo credit: The Ocean Cleanup)    ABOUT SHEPHERD KIT & GAME DEVELOPMENT  Shepherd Kit, Inc. is one of the top family and children's game design teams in Asia. Through theme construction and story-telling, Shepherd Kit introduces games that encourages children to experience the world beyond their own knowledge.        Ocean Crisis is our third project on Kickstarter. This game has been developed for  2 years  and has undergone a solid  500+ game tests  with  1000+ players  participated. These test group members include: all adult gamers, family members, classroom students with teachers, and children groups from primary school to middle school.  We believe that a good co-op game should be difficult but not impossible to beat, cooperative as a whole but competitive within, and it should possess abundant replay value after winning a game.     One of our early versions of Ocean Crisis.    Aside from the game play, we spent a great amount of time on background research. We consulted with numerous environmental specialists and organizations, participated in several environmental activities and we also learned from research reports made by authorities such as International Coastal Cleanup (ICC), United Nations Environmental Protection (UNEP), The Ocean Cleanup and etc.      During our research period, we participated in an actual coastal cleanup act. In this run, we cleaned up 1.6 tons of garbage in 2 hours.         This project is promoted by  Jellop , the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 650+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $300MM raised between them.                    \n",

      "           Nox Archaist is a tile-based, 8-bit, sword-and-sorcery role-playing game modeled after the iconic games of the 1980s.  Our goals for this project are to capture the retro-gaming experience from the 1980s and explore what might have happened if commercial RPG development had continued on 8-bit computers to the present day. Nox Archaist will be playable on both original Apple II hardware (128k enhanced Apple //e, Apple IIc, and Apple IIGS) and modern Mac and Windows PCs through emulators. For real hardware you'll need either dual floppy drives or a hard drive (such as the CFFA3000 or FloppyEMU).  We are developing Nox Archaist from scratch, in assembly language, on real Apple II hardware. We're talking handmade quality bits here. All 8 of them.

Every muscle aches from struggling against the storm, then later, against the waves. You were so close to discovering the secret of the magical barrier that threatens your homeland. Your investigations led you to a mysterious cult. But, after hearing fell voices on the winds of the storm that rose up out of nowhere, you fear that larger forces may be at play. You thought you heard the name Vazarath whispered among them. Now, shipwrecked and with your companions dead, how can you hope to accomplish your mission?  Raising your head, you see a figure approach, carrying a glowing torch. As the figure steps closer, you see that the light comes not from a torch, but from the tip of an oak staff. A black robe envelopes the figure, with a low hood that completely obscures the creature s face. A cultist? With a cry you struggle to free your sword from the clinging seaweed. As you look up, you see that the figure is simply standing there, holding out their hand. You slowly take the hand and pull yourself to your feet. As they lower their hood and smile warmly, you realize that even though you swore to defend the realm from shadow and darkness, perhaps you don t have to do it alone.  Nox Archaist is set in a sinister realm ruled by swords and sorcery. Adventurers brave enough to explore Nox Archaist will encounter engaging NPCs and a vast storyline within a sandbox world with linear storyline elements. Hordes of vile enemies will block your path to fame and riches.  Much more than just a \"hack and slash\" game, Nox Archaist will offer a rich and rewarding world to explore and discover, with many secrets, interesting stories, and a deep history to unravel.   Gamers will enjoy features like skills-driven character development and strategic turn-based combat scenarios which integrate with the game's storyline and push the boundaries of the Apple II platform.  Features that push the Apple II envelope include:     Complex world with both linear storyline and non-linear sandbox elements    Hiding in tall grass, horse jumping, swimming    NPCs with independent movement and adaptive behavior    Advanced mob combat tactics    Popup windows and other modern user interface elements      Let's take a look at our party!       Time to break out the spells and weapons!       I know, let's buy a ship!       Making camp - what could go wrong?         6502 Workshop is the grassroots game-development effort of a  small team of technology and graphics professionals . The Nox Archaist project  was born in the early 1980s  while we explored new worlds created by the Ultima and Bard's Tale series. Since then we've been driven to create our own fantasy RPG.  The original Workshop crew was fortunate enough to team up with old-school Apple II veterans who are excited to help make Nox Archaist the best gaming experience that it can be. These include:       Elizabeth Daggert , former lead programmer for Lode Runner Online.      Peter Ferrie , aka Qkumba, software developer for companies like Microsoft and Symantec by day and grandmaster assembly-language programmer by night.      Jarrod Kailef : veteran of projects such as Richard Garriott's Shroud of the Avatar and Sun Dog: Resurrection.      Michael Pohoreski : professional game developer with experience at several studios including Electronic Arts.

Stretch Goals for Nox Archaist include:        * At $30,000 we will commission a custom painting by Denis Loubet to be used as a piece of artwork within the boxed set, along with a digital download to all backers.

      "            Now that the world finally knows how much free time a nurse has to play games, there s no sense in keeping it a secret anymore.  It s time to take the games out of the supply closet and bring them back to the table where nurses can finally share them with everyone.   Nurses Playing Cards  is a game made by nurses to share that unique sense of humor that keeps us smiling even in the strangest of situations.  This Kickstarter was inspired as a direct response to Washington State Senator Maureen Walsh s inflammatory comments describing her perception of a nurse s workload. Senator Walsh stood in opposition to bill SHB 1155 that would prevent mandatory overtime for nurses as well as protect their meal and rest breaks, and on April 16, 2019 stated before the Senate that she believed nurses not only received their lawful breaks, but most likely  play cards for a considerable amount of the day.  If you, like us, couldn t believe any person would say such a thing, please watch the video of her exact statements below.       You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.     Play                                 Replay with sound         Play with   sound             00:00    00:00                                 As an individual, who has been lucky enough to have many nursing friends and family in my life, these ignorant comments filled me with frustration and anger.   As the president of Hack and Slash Game company, who has still been lucky enough to have many nursing friends and family in my life, these comments were motivating!  As a result, Hack and Slash Game company has teamed up with practicing Registered Nurses to produce a game specifically for the hardworking nurses of the world. It is a game inspired by them, made by them, and produced for them.  And if that isn't enough, if this campaign is successful, we will donate a portion of the profits to bills that will IMPROVE working conditions for nurses across the nation.  So if you are a nurse, if you are related to a nurse, if you are friends with a nurse, or if you have ever been helped by any one of the 19 million nurses in the world, help us defend the incredible service they provide for us every single day.  So come join us, show your support and back Nurses Playing Cards!       Nurses playing cards will be done in the tradition of \"Apples to Apples\" or \"Cards Against Humanity\" with the base game containing 300 cards (80 Questions and 220 Answers)    Playing is simple and easy:  1. Choose your first player  Charge Nurse  - this should be the nurse who most recently skipped a break to help a patient or fellow nurse.  If you have no nurses at the table, the person who s been awake the longest should go first.  2. Charge Nurse deals ten answer cards to each player face down. You can only look at your own hand of cards....  3. Charge Nurse draws one question card and places it face up in the center.  4. Have each other player choose a answer card....  5. Charge Nurse shuffles and reads each answer card aloud.  6. Charge Nurse chooses the best answer....  7.  Start the next round, player to the left of Charge Nurse is the now the Charge Nurse to the next round (shift).  8. Play until you're sick of it.  9. Find a nurse to make you feel better  10. Repeat PRN \n",

      "           Following the success of unmanned rover missions, the United Nations established the Department of Operations and Mars Exploration (D.O.M.E.). The first settlers arrived on Mars in the year 2037 and in the decades after establishment Mars Base Camp, private exploration companies began work on the creation of a self-sustaining colony.      Scientists    As chief astronaut for one of these enterprises, you want to be a pioneer in the development of the biggest, most advanced colony on Mars by achieving both D.O.M.E. mission goals as well as your company s private agenda.   In the beginning, you will be dependent on supplies from Earth and will have to travel often between the Mars Space Station and the planet's surface.   As the colony expands over time, you will shift your activities to construct mines, power generators, water extractors, greenhouses, oxygen factories, and shelters. Your goal is to develop a self-sustaining colony independent of any terrestrial organization. This will require understanding the importance of water, air, power, and food   the necessities for survival.  Do you dare take part in humankind s biggest challenge?     Rovers, Robots and Ships    On Mars  is played over several rounds, each consisting of two phases - the Colonization Phase    and the Shuttle Phase   .   During the Colonization Phase, each player takes a turn during which they take actions. The available actions depend on the side of the board they are on. If you are in orbit, you can take blueprints, buy and develop technologies, and take supplies from the Warehouse. If you are on the surface of the planet, you can construct buildings with your bots, upgrade these buildings using blueprints, take scientists and new contracts, welcome new ships, and explore the planet s surface with their rover.    In the Shuttle Phase, players may travel between the colony and the Space Station in orbit.        All buildings on Mars have a dependency on each other and some are required for the colony to grow. Building shelters for Colonists to live in requires oxygen; generating oxygen requires plants; growing plants requires water; extracting water from ice requires power; generating power requires mining minerals; and mining minerals requires Colonists.    Upgrading the colony s ability to provide each of these resources is vital. As the colony grows, more shelters are needed so that the Colonists can survive the inhospitable conditions on Mars.   During the game, players are also trying to complete missions. Once a total of three missions have been completed, the game ends.   To win the game, players must contribute to the development of the first colony on Mars. This is represented during the game by players gaining Opportunity Points (OP). The player with the most OP at the end of the game is declared the winner.      NOTE: Contents shown on this page are for visual representation only.

It features action-based combat with many classes to choose from including Berserker, Pyromancer, Rogue, Guardian, Knight, Ranger, Cryomancer, and more coming. Oath also has advanced social systems such as the revolutionized Guild Land system which allows guilds to purchase land and build their own base that enables special features.  Dungeons, Raids and other challenging PVE related content will play a big role in Oath. We want players to have to group up and work together to clear content and progress their characters. We want this to be a community based game, instead of players being able to solo everything. For this reason, the classes mentioned above have roles to fill, and are perfectly suited for fulfilling that role.   While PvE is a big focus of Oath, PvP will also play a strong role. The PvP Arena has multiple game modes such as 1v1, 2v2, Capture the Flag, and some new game modes exclusive to Oath will be available in both ranked and normal modes. Dive in solo or join with a group of friends, the PvP Arena is always open! You can also openly duel request anyone at any time for a quick fight anywhere in the world.  One distinction we need to make that makes Oath different is that all the Cash Shop items are cosmetic only   meaning that there is absolutely no Pay-to-win elements. Sure, you can change your outfit, weapon skin, hair, face, etc. however none of which will give you a combat bonus in game.  And of course, Oath has all the traditional MMO features. Continue reading to learn more.       Why Kickstarter?       We took an initial investment at the beginning of Oath s development, but we always said from the start that we want our players to help shape Oath - not some investment executives who have never played an MMO. Kickstarter allows us to earn the funding we need while engaging with our community - allowing for our supporters to be directly involved in the development.  We put our funding goal at the lowest possible amount that we calculated we need to get to closed beta. While this won t fund everything we want, it will get the game to a releasable state.   The funding we are looking for will almost all go towards content creation. This includes 3D models, higher quality characters (different models per class), animations, higher quality maps, icons, UI, etc. Since we developed core gameplay systems first, and are open to content, some of our rewards for pledging include voting for the content you would like to see. We will then add up all your votes and suggestions, and whatever wins will be added if that specific goal has been reached. The rest of the funding will go towards polishing and quality of life changes to anything that needs it.  As stated above, no Cash Shop items that give any pay-to-win advantage will be added. This includes Kickstarter rewards. While there are some really cool rewards, none of them give any in-game advantage.       What if the Kickstarter exceeds the goal?  We will open our Stretch Goals, which will outline what we will do with the extra funds raised. We would love for the community to be involved in this, and will work with our backers to decide what should be added with extra funds. We would like to have polls on our Discord server and allow members to vote on what we should add. If you want to join, visit https://discord.gg/Oath  How long will development take if Kickstarter is a success?   If we secure the funding needed, adding the new content to our game base won t take very long at all. If all goes well, we should be able to have our first and maybe second Alpha test late Q3 2019 into early Q4 2019. The exact dates will be announced when we have them.  During initial development, we made sure to make everything very flexible, so adding and editing content is very fast and efficient.       Will the Graphics be changed?  This is one of the more common questions so to make it clear,  everything shown in the video is temporary  (including the UI) and has only been used to develop all of our current systems. One of the main reasons for our Kickstarter is to get the funds required to dramatically improve our graphics. We will be moving away from the cartoony style shown in the Kickstarter video and will instead be creating assets much more higher quality than what has been showcased.  Vote Points  Some of our rewards include something called  Vote Points . At the end of our Kickstarter, if we are funded, we want our backers to immediately have a say in the development of Oath. So, we will launch our vote campaign where backers can login our website and vote on content they would like added. This can be things such as skills, monsters, bosses, and even playable classes. If you don't like any of the options available, you can use your points to submit a suggestion that will then allow other backers to vote on your submission.   Character Progression       We want character progression to mean something and would like to give you multiple ways to customize your characters so they can be unique instead of having the same skills and build as other players. Each class will feature multiple different skill trees and a talent tree for you to allocate points in as you level up. These trees will allow you to choose what skills your character can use and even customize the effects of the individual skills. This allows you as a player to personalize your character in your own special way. We want you to be able to play the way you want to.  Progressing in Oath will take time, it s not something that can be accomplished over a matter of days. We are trying to bring back that feeling of caring about your character and what you do in our game. Your character is something you will be working on over a large period of time.  Oath will also feature the traditional Holy Trinity system. This means we will have the usual roles of Tank, DPS and Supports. We have also decided to expand on classes and go with a class progression system. An example of this is you can start from Fighter and either progress towards a Swordsman, Berserker, Knight or Lancer.   Guild System       One of Oath s core systems is the Guild System. In exchange for some gold, players can create a Guild. You and your guild members can gain reputation points for your guild throughout the world by completing a variety of different tasks. After a high enough guild level and reputation, the guild master can buy a plot of land for your guild to build it s base.  Once you ve purchased a plot of land you can build walls, buildings and crafting benches used for life skills. Every building you can place will have a different function, such as storage, crafting benches, and buildings that help defend your base.  Guilds also have the option to declare war against others which opens up more functionality. Guilds in a guild war are in open PvP with each other. You can attack members of the enemy guild anywhere in the world. You can also invade the enemy guild s base to destroy their buildings and steal resources.   We plan on adding more guild benefits so stay tuned to our website for updates!   Trading System       We have always wanted life skills to play a big role in Oath. You will be able to craft and transport goods between different cities and continents via ground and sea for gold. Some resources will be a lot more common in certain regions at different times of year, so bringing these goods to a continent low in these resources will net you a lot more money.  Fishing will also play a major role in trading. Fish you catch will have multiple different uses. Some of these include using them for cooking, selling them to other players or trading them to a Fish Trader which will grant you currency depending on the quality of the fish. The higher level you are in Fishing the higher quality your catches will be!   Crafting System       Materials gathered through Mining, Woodcutting, Gathering and so on can all drop in different rarities. The higher level you are in that life skill the higher chance you have of obtaining higher rarity materials when gathering a resource. If you use higher quality materials when crafting you will craft much stronger items. Being high level in crafting skills will also increase the chance of your items being more powerful when crafted.  PvP       The PvP Arena is a group of PvP game modes that you can queue up for at any time. Since some players don t like questing or grinding, the PvP Arena is one of the many ways to level up if PvE content isn t for you.  We have all the classing game modes such as ranked and unranked groups (same party size or solo), Capture the Flag, Domination, and a few unique modes we don t quite have final names for yet. Some modes have character equalization which means everyone will be set to around the same level/stats so it s down to skill, not items. Again, some of these modes will give EXP so you can still level up if you love PvP.  While complete open world PvP is currently not a thing, there are some areas that have are high-risk, high-reward. There are a few areas that are open PvP enabled, but give higher EXP and better loot.  Lore       Eternia has endured centuries of conflict between the mortal factions and the Lightless. Once banished to the corners of the world, the Lightless, led by their king, Djinn, returned thirsty for revenge. Eluna, once a great symbol of peace, light and authority throughout eternia, could no longer withstand the dark power of Djinn and his demonic army, and was lost. Almost entirely defeated and driven from their ancestral homeland by demons, the mortals retreated and set sail with as many survivors as they could. Sailing through dangerous, uncharted waters without direction, the mortals eventually found the land that would change them forever. The Evervale; an ancient and magic place, long considered myth for the mortals had become their new home. A mysterious land of untold power, the Evervale had many secrets for the mortals to discover. Scholars studied and mastered the natural magic of the Evervale, harnessing the elements into spells. Weaponsmiths and armorers learned to harness its unique resources to craft new armaments, which the heroes destined to wield them learned to master their new weapons. They built towns and trading hubs, working together regardless of faction to become stronger together. They swore to never allow their home to be taken again, a solemn promise passed to the next generation of heroes to protect their new land and never let darkness overtake the light. An oath.

Due to my love of travelling, I have been given the opportunity to play this game around the world with individuals of all generations, nationalities and occupations. This has given me a glimpse into seeing first hand what this experience offers to its participants.  Sometimes I have experimented and played with individuals who may not be into a game like this and noticed a transformation in them after only 1 or 2 rounds.   Below are a few testimonials from our Game Play over the last 2 years.                                     We are now over 100% funded thanks to your support!! Our stretch goals are OPEN!

For many of the last years I have been putting my heart into this remarkable board-game. It has had different names, been modified and after constantly re-tooling and play-testing, I feel we have the perfect version for you!!   My journey was inspired by reading the Classic book Autobiography of a Yogi by Paramahansa Yogananda. I was captivated by the magical stories of India and that of the Masters, such as Babaji. I left my house inspired with $50 in my pocket and with no plans but to hitch hike from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean of Canada. Little did I know that this journey would take me travelling around the globe for many of the next 7 years and that I would meet many evolved beings along the way! These journeys opened my heart, gave me many lessons and Inspired me to create this great game Masters of Light to be of service to the world.  The journey to create this product wasn't easy to say the least, but deep in my heart I knew this product would benefit many and I keep persistent. Playing this game through out the world has allowed me to witness this as I have seen and experienced so many incredible moments along the way. One such moment is a family reuniting after 25 years due to one of the participants picking up a card to call someone on speakerphone whom she had not said \"I love you\" to in a long time. This prompted her to call her brother, who her and her family were in a bitter dispute for 25 years. Thanks to this phone call, the family has come together in peace!!! These experiences bring me great happiness and I hope you too get to experience the magic of Masters of Light!!!  LOOKING FORWARD TO PLAYING WITH YOU ALL!!!!   INFINITE GRATITUDE!! \n",

      " MASCHERATA is the new deck by Emmanuel Valtierra Illustrator (EVIL) which is inspired by old illustrations of masks and modern renaissance style disguises. This is also the third installment after ANGELOLOGIE and DEMONOLOGIE that uses this colored-handmade-engraved type of art. One last deck is remaining in this series set to be launched in a future Kickstarter campaign.       All the chosen masks were carefully selected to represent their suits. For the Kings we selected imposing masks like the plague doctor, my favorite, the Queens are beautiful female masks, for the Jacks we have animals to illustrate the cards and finally for the Jokers we have some cool masked jesters ready to entertain the public.       For the back of the card, we have chosen the green color to be dominant. This is because we want our 4 decks to have a different color. We already used red and blue for our previous decks.        Previously, I had the values of each card inside a box to resemble the old books first page letters but I decided to erase them and this way will be easier to identify while playing with them.       All the illustrations were made by hand and retouched in Photoshop.       THE CARDS  Just like the last 2 decks, this one will be printed at Legends.          52 Playing cards     2 Jokers     Custom back card design    Hand drawn illustrations    Original tuck box    ANGELOLOGIE & DEMONOLOGIE  There are a few decks left from my previous campaigns, ANGELOLOGIE & DEMONOLOGIE, the first two parts of this series of decks. Make sure to get them if you missed them. Printed in LPCC.        TUCK BOX DESIGN       DICE  The dice will be molded in \"Plasticos de Mexico\" in 2 different colors, black and white. Instead of points, we selected some symbols from the renaissance times. You can see the value of the symbols at the bottom of the photo 1 - 6 (left to right).       ADD SOME EXTRAS      \n"
